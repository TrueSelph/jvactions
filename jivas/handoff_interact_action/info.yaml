    title: Handoff Interact Action
    description: This action is designed to seamlessly handle queries or tasks that the agent cannot resolve independently. It silently transfers unresolved queries to a human operator. Once the required information or resolution is obtained, the action updates the relevant store with the response and notifies the user.
